**Situation**: All 3rd year CPUT IT students were tasked with completing the Create a CV course, as part of the Project Presentation 3 module.

**Task**: My goal was to go through the course content and complete the related assesments by or before the due date.

**Action**: I took the time to go through the course content, and completed the related assesments in time.

**Result**: Creating a comprehensive CV that is not cluttered and relevant to the job you apply for is very important. Initially, I did not realize the importance of tailoring a CV to the job being applied for.
